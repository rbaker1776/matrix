Provides a templated Matrix class for performing various matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (by a scalar), and transposition. The Matrix class supports initialization from vectors, both 1D and 2D.

Features
Initialization: Create matrices from 1D or 2D vectors.

Arithmetic Operations: Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices using the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.

Transpose: Compute the transpose of a matrix.

Utility Methods: Check if a matrix is a row or column vector, and convert a matrix to a string.
